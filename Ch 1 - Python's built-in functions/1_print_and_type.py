print("Hello World!")

# Variable declaration has three parts.
# First part is: variable name
# Second part is: assignment operator
# Third part is: variable value 


# Assignment operator:
# It passes on the value present on the right to the variable present on the left.

i = 0 # Type of variable is "int"
print(i)

j = 5 # Another variable of type "int"

# Built-in functions: something developers of the Python language want you to use out of the box.
# Ready-to-use functionality
# Like: print()
# Like: type()

# What about checking the type of a variable?

print( type(j) ) # Prints the type of variable.

print(i + j) 

print(i * j)

k = 5.2

print( type(k) ) # Prints the type of variable.



# print(j / i)

# High level languages are close to being human readable. Unlike assembly language which is close to hardware.
# A lot of functionality is coming out of the box.
# This is in reference to the Python's built-in functions.
# First natural number is 1. Why 1 is the first number?
